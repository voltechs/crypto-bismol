Professor LaVarnway,

I managed to dodge whatever has been going around for the majority of the season, but my Math professor for some insane reason insisted nobody sit near the back and as such I found myself daily sitting in front of a sick rook.

Needless to say, I've now caught whatever it is. Gonna lay low today and try not to 'pay it forward'.

I trust you'll find this acceptable.

Have a fantastic day... I'll try to as well.
